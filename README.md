# Arduino-Robot-Muscle
Arduino Robot Muscle (ARM) aims to reduce the barriers to entry into robotics by creating an easy-to-operate robotic arm control system. ARM functionally mimics the motions of a human arm, limited to four degrees of freedom, up to but not including the wrist. The  intuitive and simple control mechanism allows the user to control the larger ‘Slave ARM’ by physically manipulating a scaled-down ‘Master ARM’. This master-slave design eliminates complications and flattens the learning curves associated with the technology. Originally envisioned as a wearable device, the current prototype is scaled down to allow the user to input control motions directly into a small replica of the Slave ARM. These arms have 4 degrees of freedom. <br>

## My contributions:
1. Testing and calibration of potentiometers and servo motors.
2. Perofmring calculations to get torque requirements for the servo motors.
3. Integrated the entire system with Arduino Uno, writing code in C.
4. Debugged and assembled the master arm, minimizing deadzones in potentiometers and ensuring accurate replication of the slave arm.
